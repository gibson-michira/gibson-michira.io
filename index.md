##Hello there
:wave:
My name is Gibson, Michira. 😄

I'm a young DFIR analyst, and a bit of a software dev...sort of.
This blog of mine, is to more or less to:
- Share my knowledge around DFIR and a bit of coding 📚
- Use it to track my growth as I improve on my skills 👨‍🎓
- Learn from my mistakes 👀

I hope that you will find this content worth the read.
